This repository contains a couple of sample OpenCL applications initially
developed by me in several languages. Each sample application contains
duplicate implementations in each language (C, C++, Python, Rust & Go), this
was done to help evaluate developer time and each languages support for the
OpenCL standard. This code was the focus of a talk, which I was fortunate
enough to deliver at Linux.conf.au in 2015 at Auckland, New Zealand. The full
talk is provided here:

All code in this repository is provided under the Beer-ware license with the
hope that it'll serve as a basis in all your future OpenCL exploits. If you are
